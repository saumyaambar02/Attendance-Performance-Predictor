# Attendance-Performance-Predictor

**#Overview of the Project** 

This project is basically a menu driven Python application that helps manage students, their attendance, marks, and even predicts if a student is at risk of failing. Instead of manually checking everything, the system automates the whole process and gives simple reports and a basic prediction using ML. I made it in a modular way so each part of the system is separate and easy to understand. 


**#Features**

Add and store student details  
Mark daily attendance  
Enter exam marks  
View attendance and marks reports 
Visual charts for attendance percentage 
Predict which students might be at risk of failing (based on attendance + marks) 
Clean menu system so users can choose options easily 

  

**#Tools Used**

Python 
pandas
matplotlib 
scikit-learn 
CSV files for storing all the data 


**#Steps to Install and Run the Project**

  
1. Make sure Python is installed.
    
2. Install required libraries by running: 
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn 

3. Keep all Python files (modules) in the same folder.
    
4. Run the project using: 
python main.py  

5. Use the menu options to add students, mark attendance, add marks, etc. 

  

  

**#Instructions for Testing** 

First add at least one or two students. 

Then mark attendance for them (P or A). 

Add marks for any exam. 

After entering some data, try the reports option to see if things look fine. 

Finally, use the “Predict Risk” option and check if the model gives sensible output.
