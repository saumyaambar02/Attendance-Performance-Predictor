# Problem Statement 


Managing attendance and marks manually becomes messy very quickly, especially when you 
have multiple students and exams. Teachers also don’t easily get to know which students 
might need extra help. So this project tries to solve that by combining attendance, marks, 
and a simple predictive model into one small system. 

  
## Scope of the Project 

The project is limited to basic attendance tracking, marks entry, report viewing, 
and a simple risk prediction. It doesn’t include advanced features like login, real-time updates, 
or database systems. But for a small academic project, it covers the essential parts and works quite smoothly. 

  
## Target Users 

- Teachers who want quick attendance and marks management.
- Students who want to check their performance.
- Beginners who want to learn how modular Python projects work.
- Anyone who wants a simple system to predict student performance 

  
## High-Level Features 

- Modular design (5 main modules) 
- Menu-based interface so it’s easy to navigate 
- CSV-based storage for simplicity 
- Data analytics (attendance % and average marks) 
- Risk prediction using logistic regression 
- Graphs for attendance visualization
